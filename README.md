# Stray-Rehomer
Stray Rehomer is a web-app written in python using sqlite3 for the database. The front-end and routing are handled by flask and the jinja templating language.

The project utilizes google's Gmail API for sending and receiving emails. If you'd like to host an instance of STRAYS, you'll need to configure a working project on the google console and further configure an email address and oauth credentials for use in running the application.
